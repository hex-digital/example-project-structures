# Getting Started > Quick Start

## Prerequisites

Node 16+ (`node -v`)  
pnpm 1.22+ (`pnpm -v`)

## Setup /src directory

First, ensure you're within the `/src` directory:

```
cd src
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.dist` file, then edit this with your own values, or get them from another developer:

```
cp .env.dist .env
```

And lastly ensure you've installed the node modules using `pnpm`:

```
pnpm install
```

This will install dependencies for all pnpm workspace directories (e.g. `.`, `./src`, `./testing`, `./storybook`, etc).

### Start up

The app has two build modes: development and production.

Start the dev server for watching and hot module reloading:

```
pnpm dev -o 
# The -o flag opens a new browser window automatically. Remove if you already have a window open
```

Or build for production and run the production server:

```
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Next Steps

Now that you're up and running, you are ready to start building more of this application.
