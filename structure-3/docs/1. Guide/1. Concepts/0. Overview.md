# Guide > Concepts > Overview

This repository:

- Has several layers that split the application, including App, Domain, API, etc.
- Splits and co-locates code by domain, so you can work on individual features more easily
- Co-locates larger application features, so you can work on individual application features more easily
- Separates developer tooling from website dependencies and code, such as testing and documentation, for easier dependency management

The rest of this documentation details the repository and application structure in more detail.
